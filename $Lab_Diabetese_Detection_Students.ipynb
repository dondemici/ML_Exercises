        "**Objective:** In this lab, you will build and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier to predict the onset of diabetes in female patients of Pima Indian heritage. This exercise will provide you with hands-on experience in data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation for a real-world classification problem.\n",
        "Dataset Background: We will be using the \"Pima Indians Diabetes\" dataset, which originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The goal is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on several diagnostic measurements. All patients included in this dataset are females of Pima Indian heritage and are at least 21 years old.\n",
